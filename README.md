# GUI Based Manufacturing Cost Calculator
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) based tool for calculating the manufacturing cost of a product. The tool takes inputs such as raw material length, heat treatment cost, labor cost, overheads to compute the total manufacturing cost of the product.

# Project Description
The Manufacturing Cost Calculator is built using Python programming language and Tkinter library for the GUI interface. The tool allows users to input values for the different cost components, and automatically computes the total cost based on the user inputs.
